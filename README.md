## Current Aim
  Currently, this website aims to be my Personal Website and My Portfolio! It Contains a list of some of my most prominent projects along with contact options!
  I Personally like the UI of this Project! I also implemented horizontal scrolling to reduce the amount of scrolling required by the end user!
  Currently, planning to extend this layout to become a General Purpose template for Personal Portfolio Websites!

## TechStack Used:
  1. HTML5 (Markup)
  2. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) : Custom Styling
  3. Vanilla JavaScript
  
 ## Future Roadmap
 
  1. Integrate a way to connect to github and directly show all my projects
  2. Add a feature to view my resume
  3. Add a Chatbot
  4. Deeplinking for Apps & Especially GMAIL
